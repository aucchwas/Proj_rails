  <h2>Database Structure</h2>
  <p>Our backend database is structured into three main entities: <strong>Leagues</strong>, <strong>Teams</strong>, and <strong>Players</strong>. Each entity represents a key area of football management, and we've designed the application so that all the relevant data can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.</p>
